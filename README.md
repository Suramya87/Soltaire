1) A list of the programming patterns used, with a brief description of how you used them and why.

This project is the implementation of the class game Solitaire on Lua using Love2D. Some of the patterns used in the project was the flyweight pattern to handle most the logic of the cards in the game and also the use of states as the game needs the cards ot be in one of few states like being in the sorted pile of suites where A is the foundation of it or in the tableau where all the cards could be sorted in decreasing order with alternating colors or flipped and not visible or functional to the player.

2) A postmortem on what you did well and what you would do differently if you were to do this project over again (maybe some programming patterns that might have been a better fit?).

I feel like I was able to replicate the structure of the game down pretty well. The Lua and Love2D documentation helped out alot and not to mention talking to people and bouncing around ideas helped out with the system idea.


3) A list of all assets (sprites, SFX, fonts, music, shaders, etc.) used in this project.  Just simple links to where you found them will do.  If you created any of the assets, you have to specify.  
These are the assets I used for the cards and I used the large cards in the package
